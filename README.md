Make sure to clone the repository in your home directory
    
    git clone https://github.com/moucheh/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
    
And then run the install script, you may need to add executable permissions

    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

If you already have a config for something that is included in these dotfiles, that config will be copied to a backup folder of current date and time, it will start with a dot so, it won't be lost.

For auto tiling to work, you need to install a python package

    pip install autotiling

You may need to make it executable

    chmod +x $(which autotiling)

To enable sddm theme, you need to copy the 03-sway-fedora contents to /usr/share/sddm/themes,
as well as set it inside /etc/sddm.conf file

    sudo cp -r 03-sway-fedora /usr/share/sddm/themes/
    sudo nvim /etc/sddm.conf

Make sure you have these lines in your config file

```
[Theme]
Current=03-sway-fedora
```

If you'd like to have fingerprint unlocking as well as password unlocking
copy pam.d/swaylock contents to /etc/pam.d/swaylock

    sudo cp etc/pam.d/swaylock /etc/pam.d

You may need to delete the file if it already exists

    sudo rm /etc/pam.d/swaylock

This enables password entry as well as fingerprint scanner login.

I've also added a script that does ascii art generation for nvim dashboard.
Figlet is a dependency, you can install it through your distro's package manager.

    sudo dnf install figlet
    ~/.dotfiles/scripts/nvdash_art.sh moucheh
